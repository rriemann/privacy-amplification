\section*{Note on Qt (Framework)}

This software uses the cross-platform C++ framework Qt (pronounced like “cute”, LPGL licensed). Hence there
are some C++ language extensions.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Macros starting with \texttt{Q\_}
  \item additional keywords like \texttt{foreach} and \texttt{emit}
\end{itemize}

\texttt{emit} is part of the Signals/Slots mechanism\footnote{%
\url{http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/signalsandslots.html}} and is used to
trigger a so called Signal. Other objects, which are listening to that \emph{Signal}
might react by processing their connected \emph{Slots}. The code execution doesn't
take place immediately, but anytime later and is triggered by the global event loop.

This means that emitting a signal doesn't cause any delay, even if connected slots
rely on network.

Qt comes with a comprehensive documentation which is also available online at: \\
\url{http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/}


\section*{Detailed Description}



The most important stuff is in \texttt{QKDProcessor::incomingData(quint8
type, QVariant data)}, which is defined in \texttt{qkdprocessor.cpp}.

On loading this application, one \texttt{QKDProcessor} Object is instanciated.
The \texttt{Mainwindow} Object starts the protocol by calling
\texttt{QKDProcessor::start(bool isMaster)} after is has been made sure,
that a file was loaded and the measurements were assigned by
\texttt{QKDProcessor::setMeasurements(Measurements \*measurements)}.

Measurements are usually allocated onto the heap (using \texttt{new}) and
consists of 3 boolean properties:
\begin{description}
  \item[valid] \hfill \\ a flag which marks this measurement as valid. This is used on
               Bob's side to mark measurements with more than two registrated
               photons as invalid.
  \item[base]  \hfill \\ a flag to save the state accordingly to the chosen base out of 2.
  \item[bit]   \hfill \\ a flag to save the bit which was transfered. These bits constitutes
               later on our cryptographic key.
\end{description}

The list of pointers to all measurements is managed by a \texttt{QList} objects,
which is itself also allocated onto the heap to make it easy to pass these
measurements between a file and our \texttt{QKDProcessor} object.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={extract of measurement.h}]
struct Measurement
{
    Measurement(bool base, bool bit, bool valid = 1) : base(base), bit(bit), valid(valid) {}
    explicit Measurement() : base(0), bit(0), valid(1) {}
    Measurement &operator=(const Measurement &other)
    {base = other.base; bit = other.bit; valid = other.valid; return *this;}

    bool base;
    bool bit;
    bool valid;
};
typedef QList<Measurement*> Measurements;
\end{lstlisting}


After the processing has started, the
\texttt{QKDProcessor::incomingData(quint8 type, QVariant data)} is called
alternately by Alice, also known as \texttt{isMaster} (\texttt{bool}), and
Bob, respectively \texttt{!isMaster}.

\subsection*{Important Variables}

To keep the variable declaration right next to the code, most variables used
to implement the protocol are not declared as member variables of
\texttt{QKDProcessor}, but as \texttt{static} local variables right on top of
\texttt{incomingData} method.

\begin{description}
  \item[\texttt{qreal} error] \hfill \\ Error probability.
        The error probabilities estimated by comparing \SI{0.05}{\percent} of
        all bits. These bits were deleted immediately afterward. 
  \item[\texttt{quint16} k1] \hfill \\ Initial block size calculated by
       \texttt{calculateInitialBlockSize(qreal errorProbability)}.
  \item[\texttt{quint8} runCount] \hfill \\ This constant integer setups the limit of
        individual reorderings of all data. Each consecutive reordering doubles
        the block size starting with \texttt{k1}.
  \item[\texttt{quint8} runIndex] \hfill \\ Run index counts towards
        \texttt{runCount}.
  \item[\texttt{quint16} blockSize] \hfill \\ The actual block size can be
        determined using \texttt{runCount} and \texttt{k1}.
  \item[\texttt{Index} blockCount] The total count of blocks depends on the
        total count of measurements as well as the current \texttt{blockSize}.
        To overcome issues with incomplete blocks, the overlap gets deleted
        initially.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Program Run}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item measurement data get loaded using \texttt{setMeasurements} method
  \item protocol gets started using \texttt{start} method
  \item Alice asks Bob to send an \texttt{IndexList} of received photons (\texttt{PT01sendReceivedList}).
  \item Bob answers by sending a list of indexes with his valid measurement including with his chosen base.
  \item Alice calculated the remaining measurements taking only measurements with same base into account.
  \item Alice sends a list of indexes of his remaining measurement to Bob. (\texttt{PT01sendRemainingList})
  \item Bob receives this list, reports his to Alice and both do the sifting using \texttt{siftMeasurements}.
  \item Alice requires Bob to send back a specific count of bits (taken from the
        last measurements) to estimate the error probability (\texttt{PT02errorEstimationSendSample}).
  \item Bob responds by sending this amount of bits and deleting the appropriate
        measurements immediately.
  \item Alice compares the bits to calculate the error probability
        (\texttt{error}) and reports the absolute count of errors back to Bob
        who calculates the same error on his own (\texttt{PT02errorEstimationReport}).
  \item Both parties calculate the inital block size \texttt{k1} which depends
        \texttt{error}. Afterwards the parities are calculated at the same time.
        The initial bit order is set up to be chronological (\textit{about to change soon!}). 
  \item Alice sends Bob the order to report his blocks with wrong parities
        (corrupt block) given Alices parities (\texttt{PT04reportBlockParities}).
        
        As the block size is known to both (first \texttt{blockSize},
        \texttt{binaryBlockSize} while doing BINARY), it is sufficient to only
        refer to the index of the first measurement of the corrupt block given
        the ordering related to the current \texttt{runIndex}/\texttt{blockSize}.
  \item Bob does so and Alice receives the (maybe empty) list of corrupt blocks.
        Alice has to decide what has to be done next:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item start or continue BINARY
          \item create a new random ordering of all measurements and send it to
                Bob to enter the next level (\texttt{runIndex})
          \item go back to first level (\texttt{runIndex}) to correct new
                appearing corrupt blocks
          \item enter the next higher level which has already been taken and therefor
                it is not necessary to calculate and send a new order again
          \item finish the error correction as the last level (\texttt{runCount})
                has been reached
        \end{enumerate}

        Please read the code of \texttt{PT04reportBlockParities} for Alice
        (\texttt{if(isMaster)…}) to understand this decision in detail.

  \item For testing purposes there is a complete key exchange afterwards to
        calculate the remaining error rate.

\end{enumerate}
